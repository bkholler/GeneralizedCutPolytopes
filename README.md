# GeneralizedCutPolytopes

Some code I wrote while working on the paper "Generalized Cut Polytopes for Binary Hierarchical Models" which can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00043.
This is not official supplementary material and is not fully documented. 
 
This code generates the design matrices and polytopes of many of the objects discussed in the paper and has many useful methods that make it easier to look at examples. In particular, the method "ineqsModSwitch" allows one to nicely display all of the inequalities of a given generalized cut polytope up to switching which typically makes it much easier to analyze the H-representation of the polytope. There are also some methods that make it easy to construct unimodular simplicial complexes. 

If you have any questions about the code or want some help using it feel free to email me at bkholler@ncsu.edu.
